# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This page was created to store and share notes as I work through bootcamp with my classmates. This will help solve the problem of finding references to complete tasks since the information will be in one place. I learned how to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and access Github through this project.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to review notes I've saved in each section. To randomly select a topic to study, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
